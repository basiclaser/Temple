What is Temple?
#########################
Temple limits the number of websites you can access to 4 per hour, not including search engines. It also only allows you to keep a total of 4 tabs open.

I made Temple to force myself into a more elaborate (web-browsing)behaviour.Now I have to carefully look for the best resources for whatever it is I am studying, and once I've chosen those resources, I am inclined to appreciate them fully, and not open up another five pages in parallel looking for the quickest answers.

Abundance is the new scarcity. People trying to work in a digital environment often stagnate due to the overwhelming accessibility of information.

The more exposed we are to infinite and virtually free information, the less of it we retain. I remember the last book I read. It was the republic by plato this january. I remember what it was about in detail, yet I don't particularly remember any of the 200-odd webpages I visited yesterday.

Temple, upon installation, can also optionally scan and visualize your browser history to show you how many pages you looked at per day in recent history.

Why?
#########################
Humans have no Darwinian tendencies to moderate ourselves. Out of necessity, successful species eat and mate as much as they can. However, in an age of abundance, this genetic tendency can play to our disadvantage as we overload ourselves. This can be seen regularly in people's web-browsing behaviour.

People often bite off more than they can chew, and the end result is a computer full of browsers and tabs that are weeks old and accumulatively prevent us from having any real focus. It's a contemporary hyperform of digital hoarding.

Opening links,bookmarking them, and organising them for hours without reading them is not research. The resources will still be there when you google for them in a week to actually use them.
