Temple

How many websites did you access yesterday?
How many of them do you remember?


Temple limits the number of websites you can request to 1 per 5 minutes, not including search engines. It also only allows you to keep a total of 4 tabs open.

I made Temple to force myself into a more elaborate (web-browsing)behaviour. Now I have to carefully look for the best resources for whatever it is I am studying, and once I've chosen those resources, I am inclined to appreciate them fully, and not open up another five pages in parallel.

Abundance is the new scarcity. People trying to work in a digital environment often stagnate due to the overwhelming accessibility of information.
